	<p  style="color:purple;">The Korean War (25 June 1950 – 27 July 1953) began when North Korea invaded South Korea. The United Nations, with the United States as the principal force, 
	came to the aid of South Korea. China, with assistance from the Soviet Union, came to the aid of North Korea. 
	The war arose from the division of Korea at the end of World War II and from the global tensions of the Cold War that developed immediately afterwards.
	
	The fighting ended on 27 July 1953, when an armistice was signed. 
	The agreement created the Korean Demilitarized Zone to separate North and South Korea, 
	and allowed the return of prisoners. However, no peace treaty has been signed, 
	and the two Koreas are technically still at war. Periodic clashes, many of which are deadly, have continued to the present.</p>
