	<p style="color:blue;">The Berlin Blockade (24 June 1948 – 12 May 1949) was one of the first major international crises of the Cold War. 
	During the multinational occupation of post–World War II Germany, 
	the Soviet Union blocked the Western Allies' railway, road, and canal access to the sectors of Berlin under Western control. 
	The Soviets offered to drop the blockade if the Western Allies withdrew the newly introduced Deutsche mark from West Berlin.</p>
