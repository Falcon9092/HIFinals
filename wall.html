	<h2>The Berlin Wall was a barrier that divided Berlin from 1961 to 1989.
 Constructed by the German Democratic Republic (GDR, East Germany), 
starting on 13 August 1961, the Wall completely cut off (by land)
 West Berlin from surrounding East Germany and from East Berlin. 
 The Eastern Bloc claimed that the Wall was erected to protect 
its population from fascist elements conspiring to prevent the "will of the people" 
in building a socialist state in East Germany. In practice, the Wall served to prevent the massive emigration and defection that had marked 
East Germany and the communist Eastern Bloc during the post-World War II period.</h2>
